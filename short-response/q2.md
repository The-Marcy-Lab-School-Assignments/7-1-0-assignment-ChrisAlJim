# Question

What are the steps to incorporating context into your application?

# Answer

1. Create a new folder for your context
2. Import `createContext` from react and set it equal to whatever you want your default value to be. For example:

```js
import { createContext } from "react";

const YourContext = createContext({});

export default InstagramContext;
```

3. Render a context provider

```js
import Comp1 from "./components/Comp1";
import Comp2 from "./components/Comp2";
import { useState } from "react";

import YourContext from "./context/YourContext";

const YourApp = () => {
  const [state, setState] = useState(0);

  const contextValues = { state, setState };

  return (
    <>
      <YourContext.Provider value={contextValues}>
        <Comp1 />
        <Comp2 />
      </YourContext.Provider>
    </>
  );
};

export default YourApp;
```

Here we are setting the useState in our provider component and wrapping this provider component around our App.

# Feedback

You are correct in a lot of this, however we should wrap our context provider on our app as a best practice!
