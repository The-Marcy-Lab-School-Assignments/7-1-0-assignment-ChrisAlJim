# Question

When should Context be used?

# Answer

Context should be used when we have a component that relies on a component that is several layers deep or vice versa. For example, if we have a header that shows how many cards you have in a deck, but the button to add a card in the deck is in a container which is in div which is in an article. We could use prop drilling but it is a little tedious so instead we can use Context.
